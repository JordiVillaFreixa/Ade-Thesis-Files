This a GROMACS simulation using the Emperical Valence Bond for the hydrolysis of cis-Stilbene oxide with Limonene Epoxide Hydroxylase(LEH)
The simulation protocol was inspired by that carried out by Gabriel Onca et al., 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00714). The supporting files and tools used during his simulation can be found in https://github.com/gabrieloanca/ JCTC_2023.git and https://github.com/gabrieloanca/gmxtools.git. The suuporting document for his simulation is found at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00714/suppl_file/ct3c00714_si_001.pdf.
