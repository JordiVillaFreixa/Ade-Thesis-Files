This folder contains the files for the EVB simulation with water. The files present her are just that for the preparation and the relaxation of the system.
The  parameters used for this simulation is same as that used for the wild type and the mutants
Restraints (5 kcal/mol) were included during the relaxation and FEP simulation for the Asp132 and Arginine amino acid residue.
