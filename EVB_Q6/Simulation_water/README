# Simulation in water

This folder contains files related to the preparation and relaxation phases of the EVB simulation in water. The parameters used here are the same as those applied to both the wild-type and mutant systems.

Since the amino acids were capped, RESP charges were recalculated for the various species. These recalculated charges can be found in the "reactant" sub-directory.

During the relaxation and FEP simulations, restraints of 5 kcal/mol were applied to the Asp132 and Arginine residues.
