This folder contains the files for the EVB simulation with water. The files present here are for the preparation and the relaxation of the system.
The  parameters used for this simulation is same as that used for the wild type and the mutants.
Since the amino acids were capped, there was a recalculation of the RESP charges for the various species. These results obtained can be found in the sub-directory called "reactant".  
Restraints (5 kcal/mol) were included during the relaxation and FEP simulation for the Asp132 and Arginine amino acid residue.
